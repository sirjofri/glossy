glossy
======

**A LaTeX package for interlinear glosses.**

Introduction
------------

The `glossy` package provides a simple solution for interlinear glosses. It's
strength is typesetting glosses over multiple lines *and* pages. If you need
more advanced features look into other packages (like
[expex](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/expex)).

For usage information and more information in general, see
[glossy.pdf](glossy.pdf).

Installation
------------

This package provides a `Makefile` rule for installing the necessary files in
your local `texmf`. Installation then works with `make install`.

Alternatively you can of course `make` the `.sty` file (`latex glossy.ins`)
and copy the `glossy.sty` file manually.

Bug reports/Contribution
------------------------

This package is (at the moment) hosted on github. You can report your bugs
there ([package link](https://github.com/sirjofri/glossy/)).
